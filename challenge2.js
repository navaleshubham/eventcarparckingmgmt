APIs are used in JS to communicate data between server and client.

We have a sample endpoint here 

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos

Open this in your browser to checkout what data is this API endpoint sending.

Your task is to use this API, fetch and parse data and then present it in a table using a
js table library called datatables. https://datatables.net/ 

So simply parse the JSON and display all the tasks in the table using this library.

In the task objects in JSON one of the key is completed which is either false or true.
In this column in the table, instead of displaying true or false, display a checkbox,
if, completed is true, checkbox should be ticked, if completed is false checkbox should be not ticked.

// If you have any questions, ask them without any hesistation on the chat like you would ask when you will be
// doing your internship. This is how you will learn and grow.

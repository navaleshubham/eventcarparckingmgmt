You are the tech lead of a big music fest being organized.
For all the VIPs arriving and to serve them in a better way,
we need an app in which we can store who's car has been parked where.

Every parking has a 3 letter unique code of format XXX where X can be any alphabet (A-Z) or a number.

Your job is to quickly design a REST API which can be integrated in the main music fest app.

This REST API should be successfully able to store when someone parked a car, storing their name. mobile number and car's number. It should be able to mark event when someone unparked and the spot got empty.

It should be able to search by name or car's number (even if the input is incomplete, it should return all matching entries).

It should store the timestamp automatically when someone parked a car or when someone unparked a car.

At any point of time it should give you how many spots are empty and give you a random empty parking spot.

you have to carefully plan what all routes will be required to store complete functionality required in a parking spot.

Design a REST API in language of your choice, PHP is suggested but you can choose whatever you are comfortable with. Don't use any API generators please. 

Follow the best practices of naming routes.

If you have any questions, ask them without any hesistation on the chat like you would ask when you will be doing your internship. This is how you will learn and grow.
